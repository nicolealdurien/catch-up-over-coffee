    question: "Fatty fish is a good source of what nutrient?",
    answer:
      "Omega-3s. Fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, halibut, and black cod provide omega-3 fats, which may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and other disorders.  It's best to get your omega-3s from fish rather than supplements; recent studies show diminished absorption from omega-3 pills as compared to fish.",

    question: "True/False: Multigrain breads are always whole-grain.",
    answer:
      "False. The term 'multigrain' means only that more than one grain is present. The primary ingredient is usually refined wheat flour. Whole-grain flour contains the bran and the germ, and so is rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Refining wheat removes nutrients, and even when it's 'enriched', only some are added back. A true whole-grain bread lists only whole grains in the ingredients, not 'wheat' or 'enriched wheat', which is simply refined (white) flour.",

    question:
      "Which food is highest in potassium - a medium banana or one cup of yogurt?",
    answer:
      "Yogurt. While bananas are an excellent source of potassium, with 420 milligrams, many other foods have even more! Yogurt has 530 mg/cup, orange juice has 500mg/cup, and broccoli has 460mg/cup. Also rich in potassium are tomatoes, apricots, spinach, beets, prune juice, potatoes, lentils, soybeans, nuts, and sunflower seeds. A potassium-rich diet helps control blood pressure. The goal is 4,700 mg per day.",

    question:
      "True/False: A label that lists trans fats at 'zero' means that the food contains no trans fat.",
    answer:
      "False. Because of the way labeling regulations are worded, a 'trans-fat free' food may still contain small amounts of partially hydrogenated oil (<0.5g per serving). These trace amounts can add up, especially since standard serving sizes are often small.",

    answer:
      " HDL.

Higher levels of HDL can reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke.",

    question:
      "Vitamin D is found in which of the following foods: eggs, milk, or mushrooms?",
    answer:
      "All of the above! Milk is fortified with vitamin D and is the major dietary source, with 100 IU per cup. Small amounts of vitamin D are also present in fatty fish, egg yolks and mushrooms. Orange juice, soy milk, margarine, yogurt, and breakfast cereal may also be fortified. But to get the 800 to 1,000 IU a day we recommend, vitamin D supplements are usually necessary, since it's difficult to get this much from food.",
