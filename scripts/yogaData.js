The arms are extended straight and are turned slightly outward at the shoulder joint so the elbow creases face forward without squeezing the shoulder blades together.  The neck is in a relatively neutral position, neither flexed nor extended, or (for the advanced practitioners only) the head drops back.  Be careful not to strain your neck and harden your throat.
